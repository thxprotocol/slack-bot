### Prerequisites

#### 1. [Signup for a THX account](https://www.thx.network/signup)

Signup is free while we are in beta so let's give it a try!

#### 2. [Create an Application & ERC20 pool](https://dashboard.thx.network)

The application is used to authorize with our API. You can create your own ERC20 token with a limited or unlimited supply and deploy it in a fresh asset pool. Deploying your smart contract can take up to ~20 seconds.

> Make sure to edit you asset pool after deployment and disable the governance setting. This feature is currently not supported by the THX Bot.
